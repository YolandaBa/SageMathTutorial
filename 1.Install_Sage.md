# SageMath Tutorial
## 🛠️ Installing SageMath

This section guides you through installing SageMath on **macOS** or **Windows**.

---

### 🍎 macOS

**Option 1: Download Prebuilt App**
- Go to [https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases](https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases)
- Download the latest `.dmg` file and install SageMath like a regular application.

**Option 2: Install via Conda (from conda-forge)**

Make sure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.

Then run the following commands in your terminal:

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 Install with Mamba (recommended)</strong></summary>

```bash
# Install mamba (if you haven't already)
conda install -n base conda-forge::mamba

# Create Sage environment with Python 3.12 (or whatever version you want)
mamba create -n sage sage python=3.12
# Activate the environment
conda activate sage
# Launch SageMath
sage
```
</details>
<details> <summary><strong>🔹 Install with Conda </strong></summary>

```bash
# Or with Conda
conda create -n sage sage python=3.12
# Activate the environment
conda activate sage
# Launch SageMath
sage
```
</details>

### 🪟 Windows (Recommended: WSL)

The best way to run SageMath on Windows is through **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** with Ubuntu.

---

#### Step 1: Set Up WSL

Follow [Microsoft’s WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or use the steps below:

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 Enable and Install WSL</strong></summary>

1. Make sure hardware-assisted virtualization is enabled in your system’s BIOS or EFI.
2. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:
```powershell
wsl --install
```
This installs Ubuntu Linux by default. If you already have WSL installed using older steps, check that you're using WSL 2:  
```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```
3. Set up your Linux username and password (no spaces in the username).

4. If your computer has less than 8 GB of RAM, change the WSL memory allocation to give at least 4 GB.

#### Step 2: Install SageMath via Miniforge

<details> <summary><strong>🔹 Download and Set Up Miniforge</strong></summary>

1.  Launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu.

2. Download and install Miniforge:

```powershell
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"

bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```
3. Follow the prompts to complete installation (press Enter or type yes when asked). 

</details> 
<details> <summary><strong>🔹 Create a SageMath Environment</strong></summary>

```powershell
conda create -n sage sage python=3.11
```
 </details> <details> <summary><strong>🔹 Activate and Run Sage</strong></summary>

```powershell
conda activate sage
sage
```
</details>


## Way to Use Sage
- Notebook: You can run `sage -n jupyter` to open the graphical notebook interface.
- Interactive command line: either type `sage` in your terminal, or in python do `from sage.all import *`. See The [Interactive Shell](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/interactive_shell.html#chapter-interactive-shell). 
- If you install the app, just click on Command line or Notebook, and then Lauch!
