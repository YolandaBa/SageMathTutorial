# ðŸ“˜ SageMath Tutorial

Author: Yolanda Ba

This repository contains a step-by-step, code-driven guide to learning **representation theory** using **SageMath**. Each section pairs **formal mathematical definitions** with live **Sage code**, ideal for students or researchers wanting a hands-on introduction.

(This repo is created for my Math 174 Representation theory project).


## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1.Install_Sage.md` | Instructions for installing SageMath locally or online. |
| `2.basic_tutorial_code.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook covering Sage syntax essentials (variables, algebra, calculus). |
| `2.Basic_tutorial.md` | Markdown companion for the basic Sage tutorial. |
| `3.RepTheory_code.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook for representation theory with live examples. |
| `3.Sage_RepTheory_tutorial.md` | Full markdown cheat-sheet covering group representations, characters, standard/regular representations, and more. |

PS: Part 2 contains the basic functionality of Sage. Only part 3 of the repo is focus on rep theory. 

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
- Jupyter or compatible Markdown viewer  
- Basic knowledge of group theory recommended

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Start with `1.Install_Sage.md` to set up SageMath.
2. Read the markdown file for detail explanation (references or printable handouts). 
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in order:
   - `2.basic_tutorial_code.ipynb`
   - `3.RepTheory_code.ipynb`

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- âœ… Variable assignment, exact arithmetic
- âœ… Solving differential equations and symbolic algebra in Sage
- âœ… Constructing matrix representations of finite groups
- âœ… Key examples: trivial, permutation, regular, and standard representations
