# 🎭 Representation Theory in SageMath  

This notebook provides a concise, definition-driven introduction to representation theory using SageMath. Each concept is paired with formal definitions from group theory and immediately followed by runnable Sage code. It's designed for hands-on exploration — ideal for learning by doing.

Disclaimer: 
- Although the cell are label with python, they are indeed Sage cell. Python highligh looks much better than plain txt.
- Some of the representation is implemented by myself. It may not be correct.

## 1. Building Groups

> **Definition.**  
> A **group** $G$ is a set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses.

**Sage**

```sage
# Some common groups
Cn = CyclicPermutationGroup(5)       # C₅
S4 = SymmetricGroup(4)               # S₄
Dn = DihedralGroup(6)                # D_12
Cn.order(), S4.order(), Dn.order()
```

## 2. Group Representations

> **Definition: Representation**  
> Definition 1.2.1 A matrix representation of a group $G$ is >a group homomorphism
>$$ X: G \rightarrow G L_d$$
>Equivalently, to each $g \in G$ is assigned $X(g) \in  \operatorname{Mat}_d$ such that
>1. $X(\epsilon)=I$ the identity matrix, and
>2. $X(g h)=X(g) X(h)$ for all $g, h \in G$.
>The parameter $d$ is called the degree, or dimension, of the representation and is denoted by $\operatorname{deg} X$.

Sage Math doesn't have build in function to representation, but it is possible to write our own function to build representation. 


### 2.1 Trivial Representation

> **Definition: Trivial Representation**  
> The **trivial representation** of $ G $ is the 1-dimensional representation $ \rho $ such that $ \rho(g) = 1 $ for all $ g \in G $.

**Sage**

```python
def triv(g):
    return matrix.identity(n)
g = G.an_element()
show(perm(g))
```

---

### 2.2 Permutation Representation

> **Definition: Permutation Representation**  
> Let $ G $ act on a finite set $ S $. The corresponding **permutation representation** is the linear action of $ G $ on the complex vector space $ \mathbb{C}[S] $ given by permuting basis vectors.

**Sage**

This isn't very interesting. However, we also know that $S_3$ is the group of permutations of the 3 -element set $\{ 1,2,3\}$. We can associate to each permutation a permutation matrix. Sage already has this implemented for us, via the method ``matrix()`` for a group element g :

```python
def triv(g):
    return matrix.identity(n)
g = G.an_element()
show(perm(g))
```
Each group element acts as a permutation matrix on the basis elements of $ \mathbb{C}[G] $. This representation contains all irreducible representations as direct summands.

### 2.3 Regular Representation

> **Definition (Regular Representation).**  
> Short: Regular representation is recoverd a group $G$ acting on itself from the left.

> **Definition (Regular Representation).**  
> Let $G$ be a finite group and $H \leq G$ a subgroup.  
> The **regular representation** of $G$ relative to $H$ is defined by letting $G$ act on the set of left cosets
> $$
> \mathcal{H} = \{g_1 H,\, g_2 H,\, \ldots,\, g_k H\}
> $$
> where $\{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_k\}$ is a transversal (i.e., a set of representatives for the distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$).  
> The action is given by:
> $$
> g \cdot (g_i H) = (g g_i) H \quad \text{for all } g \in G.
> $$
> 
> This action extends linearly to a complex vector space:
> $$
> \mathbb{C}[\mathcal{H}] = \left\{c_1\, g_1 H + c_2\, g_2 H + \cdots + c_k\, g_k H \,\middle|\, c_i \in \mathbb{C} \right\},
> $$
> with the action:
> $$
> g \cdot \left(c_1\, g_1 H + \cdots + c_k\, g_k H\right) = c_1\, (g g_1 H) + \cdots + c_k\, (g g_k H).
> $$
> 
> This defines a representation of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}[\mathcal{H}]$, generalizing the regular representation when $H = \{e\}$.

**Sage**
(Implemented by myself, not grantee in correctness)
```python
from sage.all import matrix, QQ, CyclicPermutationGroup

def regular_rep_matrix(G, g, side="right", base_ring=QQ):
    """
    Return the regular–representation matrix of the group element g ∈ G.
    """
    basis = list(G)
    n     = len(basis)
    if side not in ("right","left"):
        raise ValueError("side must be 'right' or 'left'")
    def act(h):
        return h*g if side=="right" else g*h
    return matrix(base_ring, n, n,
                  lambda i,j: 1 if act(basis[i])==basis[j] else 0)
```


### 2.4 Standard Representation
> **Definition: Standard Representation**  
> Let $G = S_n$ be the symmetric group on $n$ elements. The **standard representation** of $G$ is the $(n-1)$‑dimensional subrepresentation of the permutation representation on the vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$ given by:
>
> $$
> V = \{ (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n \mid x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = 0 \}.
> $$
>
> The group $S_n$ acts on $V$ by permuting coordinates. This action defines a linear representation of $S_n$ on $V$.
>
> The standard representation is irreducible for $n \geq 3$ and excludes the 1-dimensional trivial component corresponding to constant vectors.

**Sage**
(Implemented by myself, not grantee in correctness)
```python
def standard_representation(G, base_ring=QQ):
    """
    Return the standard (or reflection) representation of a permutation group G.
    
    INPUT:
      - G         : a permutation group of degree n (e.g. SymmetricGroup(n))
      - base_ring : the base field/ring (default QQ)
    
    OUTPUT:
      The submodule of the permutation module of G of dimension n−1,
      spanned by the vectors e₁−e₂, e₂−e₃, …, eₙ₋₁−eₙ.
    """
    # 1) Build the permutation module on basis {e₁,…,eₙ}
    M = G.permutation_module(base_ring=base_ring)
    e = M.basis()            # e[0]=e₁, …, e[n-1]=eₙ
    n = len(e)
    # 2) Form the standard submodule
    std_basis = [e[i] - e[i+1] for i in range(n-1)]
    return M.submodule(std_basis)

# Example usage:
G = SymmetricGroup(5)
std = standard_representation(G)
std.dimension()          # ⇒ 4
std.matrix(G((1,2)))     # matrix of the transposition (1 2) in the standard rep

## 3. Characters

> **Definition: Irreducible** 
> A nonzero $G$-module $V$ is reducible if it contains a nontrivial submodule $W$. Otherwise, $V$ is said to be irreducible. 


> **Definition: Character**  
> Let $X(g), g \in G$, be a matrix representation. Then the character of $X$ is
>$$\chi(g)=\operatorname{tr} X(g)$$
>where $\operatorname{tr}$ denotes the trace of a matrix. Otherwise put, $\chi$ is >the map
>$$G \xrightarrow{\operatorname{tr} X} \mathbb{C} .$$
>If $V$ is a $G$-module, then its character is the character of a matrix representation $X$ corresponding to $V$.

> **Definition: Character**  
> Let $G$ be a group. The **character table** of $G$ is an array with rows indexed by the inequivalent irreducible characters of $G$ and columns indexed by the conjugacy classes. The table entry in row $\chi$ and column $K$ is $\chi_K$:
>
> $$
> \begin{array}{c|ccc} 
>   & \cdots & K & \cdots \\
>   \hline
>   \vdots & & \vdots & \\
>   \chi   & \cdots & \chi_K & \cdots \\
>   \vdots & & &
> \end{array}
> $$
>
> By convention, the first row corresponds to the **trivial character**, and the first column corresponds to the class of the identity, $K = \{\epsilon\}$.




### 🧮 Character Tables in SageMath

This quick guide shows how to compute and interpret the **character table** of a finite group using SageMath.




```python
G = SymmetricGroup(3)
G.order()        # ⇒ 6
G.conjugacy_classes()
# Return a CharacterTable object
T = G.character_table()
```
